## Credits

The earthquake data is sourced from the kandilli observatory and earthquake research institute (KOERI)

The app also uses the Kandilli Rasathanesi API (https://github.com/orhanayd/kandilli-rasathanesi-api) to retrieve earthquake data in Turkey. We would like to thank Orhan AYDIN (https://github.com/orhanayd) for creating and maintaining this API.

We would also like to thank Mehmet Ali Pekcan (https://github.com/mapelse) for creating and sharing the Fay HatlarÄ± project (https://github.com/mapelse/fayHatlari), which helped us to include all of the fault lines in Turkey in the app.
